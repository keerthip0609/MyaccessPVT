The project is based on Predicting Customer Lifetime Value in Python

To maintain a long-term relationship with customers, companies need to schedule loyalty schemes such as discounts, offers, coupons, bonus points, and gifts.

Targeting a new customer is more costly than retaining existing customers because you donâ€™t need to spend resources, time, and work hard to acquire new customers.
You just have to keep the existing customers happy. Business analyst accurately calculates customer acquisition costs using CLTV(Customer Lifetime Value).
CLTV indicates the total revenue from the customer during the entire relationship. CLTV helps companies to focus on those potential customers who can bring in more revenue in the future.

Customer Life Time value(CLTV) is a monetary value that represents the amount of revenue or profit a customer will give the company throughout the relationship.
CLTV demonstrates the implications of acquiring long-term customers compared to short-term customers.
Customer lifetime value (CLV) can help you answer the most important questions about sales to every company:

How to Identify the most profitable customers?
How can a company offer the best product and make the most money?
How  profitable are customer segments?
How much budget needs to be spent to acquire customers?
